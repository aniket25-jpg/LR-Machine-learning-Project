This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict delivery times for a logistics application using key operational features such as delivery distance, order volume, and time of day. Accurate delivery time prediction is critical for improving customer experience, planning logistics operations, and optimizing resource allocation.

A Linear Regression model is implemented as a baseline predictive solution, supported by proper data preprocessing, feature engineering, and performance evaluation.

🎯 Business Problem

Logistics companies face daily challenges in:

->  Accurately estimating delivery times

->  Allocating delivery partners efficiently

->  Managing peak-hour demand

->  Reducing delays and customer dissatisfaction

This project provides a data-driven solution to estimate delivery times and support operational decision-making.

🎯 Tech Stack

-> Python

-> Pandas, NumPy

-> Scikit-learn

-> Matplotlib / Seaborn

-> Jupyter Notebook

🎯 Methodology & Workflow

-> Data loading and cleaning

-> Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

-> Feature engineering

-> Log transformation to handle skewed features

-> Feature scaling (Standardization)

-> Model training using Linear Regression

Model evaluation using:

-> R² Score

-> MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

-> RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

🎯 Model Performance

The model is evaluated using:

-> R² Score to measure explained variance

-> MAE to measure average prediction error

-> RMSE to penalize large errors

These metrics ensure the model is both accurate and reliable for operational usage.
