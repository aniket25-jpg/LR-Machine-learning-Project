This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict delivery times for a logistics application using key operational features such as delivery distance, order volume, and time of day. The goal is to help logistics teams improve planning, optimize resource allocation, and enhance overall operational efficiency.
A linear regression model was engineered as the baseline predictive solution. To improve model performance and handle skewed data distributions, log transformation was applied to relevant features, and feature scaling was used to ensure consistent input ranges across variables. These preprocessing steps significantly improved model stability and accuracy.
The model’s performance was evaluated using standard regression metrics including R² (R-squared), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), and RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) to ensure both accuracy and reliability of predictions.
This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end machine learning workflow including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation. The final model serves as a foundational analytics tool that can support data-driven decision-making in logistics operations, such as delivery time estimation, workload balancing, and route planning optimization.
